SMIT_Batch18_2025

This repository contains the weekly assignments and project exercises completed during SMIT Batch 18 (2025). It is a central workspace for all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript based exercises assigned as part of the SMIT curriculum.

📘 Overview

As a student of web development, I’m using this repo to:

Organize all lab assignments and practice files from SMIT courses. Track progress in frontend development fundamentals like layout, responsiveness, interaction, and DOM logic. Build a portfolio of work I can reference when applying for internships. This repo reflects structured practice, from early linking and page layout to small interactive components built with JavaScript.

📂 Structure

Each assignment is placed in its own folder, named according to the task and sequence:

SMIT_Batch18_2025/ ├─ Assignment_1(Linking)/ ├─ Assignment_2(Gmail_Login_Page)/ ├─ Assignment_3(Responsiveness)/ ├─ Assignment_4(Color_Palette)/ ├─ Assignment_6(Calculator)/ ├─ Assignment_7(Digital_Clock)/ └─ README.md

🚀 How to Use

To review an assignment: Clone the repository to your system. Open the assignment folder you’re interested in. Load the .html file in your browser to run the project. Inspect CSS and JS files to understand layout and logic decisions. Each folder has its own internal structure; typically: index.html as entry point styles.css (or similar) for styling script.js (where applicable) for interactive behavior

💡 Learning Goals

This repo supports:

Understanding semantic HTML structure. Implementing responsive layouts with CSS. Practicing JavaScript fundamentals and DOM manipulation. Developing clean project organization habits. As you practice, focus on why decisions were made in structure, classes, and scripts. This will deepen reasoning as you build your frontend foundations.

📌 Notes

Assignments may vary in complexity from simple static pages to small interactive components.

Consistent folder naming helps with clarity and progression tracking.

This repository will grow as new SMIT assignments and projects are added.
